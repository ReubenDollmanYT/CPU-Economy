# ThonkBot

This is the as the github reposetory for the most receant working update of ThonkBot

You may copy any amount of the code from it as you want, but I think it would be better to read it and try and understand what it does.
If you can't understand what it does, DM Book#1785 on discord asking. I will be happy to help.

## What you need for this to work:

### You are required to have python

### Pip installs (Do these in cmd)
   pip install discord.py
   pip install apscheduler
   pip install git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus
   pip install pybelieva==0.1.0.dev2
